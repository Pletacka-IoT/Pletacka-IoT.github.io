# Integration into Industry 4.0

## Pletačka IoT (iSocks IoT)

### What is iSocks IoT?
iSocks IoT is a system for automatic monitoring of industrial production and its implementation in practice.

The system was designed as a universal platform for monitoring production machines, with a primary focus on knitting machines.

### System model
It consists of a sensor part, a web server and a support server, which controls the operation of the entire system. All parts communicate with each other via WiFi

### Deployment
The iSocks IoT system is used in the Rotex Vysočina company on 10 sock knitting machines.
The company works in two shifts and produces about 12,000 pairs of socks a month.
The system ensures constant monitoring of selected machines and has recorded over one million knitted socks during its operation

The sensors are designed for universal use. It is therefore possible to connect them to any industrial device and calculate, for example, the production of manufactured parts.
